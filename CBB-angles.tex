\section{Quotient space}

Suppose that group $G$ acts isometrically on a metric space $\spc{X}$.
Note that
\[\dist{G\cdot x}{G\cdot y}{\spc{X}/G}
\df
\inf
\set{\dist{x}{g\cdot y}{\spc{X}}}{g\in G}\]
defines a semimetric on the orbit space $\spc{X}/G$.
Moreover, it is a genuine metric if the orbits of the action are closed.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:CBB/G}
Assume that group $G$ acts isometrically on a proper $\Alex0$ space $\spc{L}$ and has closed orbits.
Then the quotient space $\spc{L}/G$ is $\Alex0$.

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $\sigma\:\spc{L}\to \spc{L}/G$ the quotient map.

Fix a quadruple of points $p,x_1,x_2,x_3\in \spc{L}/G$.
Choose an arbitrary $\hat p\in \spc{L}$ such that $\sigma(\hat{p})=p$.
Since $\spc{L}$ is proper, we can choose the points $\hat{x}_1,\hat{x}_2,\hat{x}_3\in \spc{L}$ such that $\sigma(\hat x_i)=x_i$ and
\[\dist{p}{x_i}{\spc{L}/G}
=
\dist{\hat{p}}{\hat{x}_i}{\spc{L}}\]
for all $i$.

Note that 
\[\dist{x_i}{x_j}{\spc{L}/G}
\le 
\dist{\hat{x}_i}{\hat{x}_j}{\spc{L}}
\]
for all $i$ and $j$.
Therefore 
\[\angk p{x_i}{x_j}
\le
\angk {\hat{p}}{\hat{x}_i}{\hat{x}_j}
\eqlbl{eq:angles-M-L}\]
holds for all $i$ and $j$.

By $\Alex0$ comparison in $\spc{L}$,
we have
\[\angk {\hat{p}}{\hat{x}_1}{\hat{x}_2}
+\angk {\hat{p}}{\hat{x}_2}{\hat{x}_3}
+\angk {\hat{p}}{\hat{x}_3}{\hat{x}_1}
\le 
2\cdot\pi.\]
Applying  \ref{eq:angles-M-L}, 
we get 
\[\angk p{x_1}{x_2}
+\angk p{x_2}{x_3}
+\angk p{x_3}{x_1}< 2\cdot\pi;\]
that is,
the $\Alex0$ comparison holds for this quadruple in $\spc{L}/G$.

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}
Let $G$ be a compact Lie group with a bi-invariant Riemannian metric.
Show that $G$ is isometric to a quotient of the Hilbert space by isometric group action.

Conclude that $G\in\CBB(0)$.
\end{thm}

\section{Submetries}

A map $\sigma\:\spc{X}\to\spc{Y}$ between the metric spaces $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$
is called a \index{submetry}\emph{submetry} if 
\[\sigma(\oBall(p,r)_\spc{X})=\oBall(\sigma(p),r)_{\spc{Y}}\]
for any $p\in \spc{X}$ and $r\ge 0$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:sumbetries(S^2)}
Construct submetries
\begin{subthm}{}
$\sigma_1\:\mathbb{S}^2\to[0,\pi]$
\end{subthm}
\begin{subthm}{}
$\sigma_2\:\mathbb{S}^2\to[0,\tfrac\pi2]$
\end{subthm}
\begin{subthm}{}
$\sigma_n\:\mathbb{S}^2\to[0,\tfrac\pi n]$ (for integer $n\ge 1$)
\end{subthm}
such that the fibers $\sigma_n^{-1}\{x\}$ are connected for any $x$.
\end{thm}

Suppose $G$ and $\spc{L}$ are as in \ref{thm:CBB/G}.
Observe that the quotient map $\sigma\:\spc{L}\to \spc{L}/G$ is a submetry.
Moreover, the proof above (with minor changes) works for any submetries.
Therefore we get the following.


\begin{thm}{Generalization}\label{thm:submetry-CBB}
Let $\sigma\:\spc{L}\to\spc{M}$ be a submetry.
Suppose $\spc{L}$ is a $\Alex{0}$ space, then so is $\spc{M}$.
\end{thm}

Theorems \ref{thm:CBB/G} and \ref{thm:submetry-CBB} admit straightforward generalizations to $\CBB(-1)$ spaces.
In the $\CBB(1)$ the proof produces a slightly weaker statement ---  \textit{any open $\tfrac\pi2$-ball in the quotient of $\CBB(1)$ is $\CBB(1)$};
in particular, the quotient space is \textit{locally} $\CBB(1)$.
If the space is geodesic, then the globalization theorem implies that it is globally  $\CBB(1)$.
The same holds for the targets of submetry from a  $\CBB(1)$ space.

\section{Hopf's conjecture}

Recall that Hopf's conjecture states that \textit{$\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$ does not admit a Riemannian metric with positive sectional curvature}.
The following partial result was obtained by Wu-Yi Hsiang and Bruce Kleiner \cite{hsiang-kleiner}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:hsiang-kleiner}
There is no Riemannian metric on $\SSS^2\times\SSS^2$ with sectional curvature $\ge 1$ and nontrivial isometric $\SSS^1$-action.
\end{thm}

We will give a ruf sketch of proof that will use many statements and notions that are not yet introduced.
Nevertheless, it should be possible to follow the proof with intuitive understanding of boundary and dimension of a quotient space.
The statements include 
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{Toponogov comparison theorem} and the \emph{globalization theorem}.
The former says  that \textit{a complete Riemannian manifold has sectional curvature $\ge \kappa$ if and only if the corresponding metric space is $\CBB(\kappa)$}.
The later says that \textit{a complete geodesic locally $\CBB(\kappa)$ space is $\CBB(\kappa)$}.
\item \emph{Doubling theorem:} \textit{Doubling of a finite-dimensional geodesic $\CBB(\kappa)$ space is a geodesic $\CBB(\kappa)$ space}
\item \emph{Splitting theorem:} \textit{A geodesic $\CBB(0)$ space that contains a line splits isometrically as $\RR\times \spc{X}$};
here \emph{line} is a both-side infinite geodesic.
\end{itemize}

In addition, we will use the following exercise that will be proved latter:


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:S^3/S^1}
Suppose $\SSS^1\acts\SSS^3$ be an isometric action without fixed points 
and $\Sigma=\SSS^3/\SSS^1$ is its quotient space.
Then there is a distance noncontracting map $\Sigma\to \tfrac12\cdot \SSS^2$, where $\tfrac12\cdot \SSS^2$ is the standard 2-sphere rescaled with factor $\tfrac12$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Sketch of \ref{thm:hsiang-kleiner}.}
Let $\spc{M}=(\SSS^2\times\SSS^2,g)$ be a counterexample.

Recall that $\spc{M}$ is $\CBB(1)$.
By \ref{thm:CBB/G}, the quotient space $\spc{L}=\spc{M}/\SSS^1$ is $\CBB(1)$;
evidently, $\spc{L}$ is 3-dimensional.

Denote by $F\subset \spc{M}$ the fixed point set of the $\SSS^1$-action.
Each connected component of $F$ is either an isolated point or a 2-dimensional submanifold in $\spc{M}$;
the latter has to have positive curvature and therefore it is either $\SSS^2$ or $\RP^2$.
Notice that 
\begin{itemize}
 \item each isolated point contributes 1 to the Euler characteristic of~$\spc{M}$,
 \item each sphere contributes 2 to the Euler characteristic of $\spc{M}$, and
 \item each projective plane contributes 1 to the Euler characteristic of~$\spc{M}$.
\end{itemize}
Since $\chi(\spc{M})=4$, we are in one of the following three cases:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $F$ has exactly 4 isolated points,
 \item $F$ has one 2-dimensional submanifold and at least 2 isolated points,
 \item $F$ has at least two 2-dimensional submanifolds.
\end{itemize}
Each case is covered separately.

\parit{Case 1.}
Suppose $F$ has exactly 4 isolated points $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, and $x_4$.
Denote by $y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$, and $y_4$ the corresponding points in $\spc{L}$.
Note that $\Sigma_{y_i}\spc{L}$ is isometric to a quotient of $\SSS^3$ by an isometric $\SSS^1$-action without fixed points.

By \ref{ex:S^3/S^1}, each angle $\mangle\hinge{y_i}{y_j}{y_k}\le \tfrac\pi2$ for any three distinct points 
$y_i$, $y_j$, $y_k$.
In particular, all four triangles $[y_1y_2y_3]$, $[y_1y_2y_4]$, $[y_1y_3y_4]$, and $[y_2y_3y_4]$ are nondegenerate.
By comparison, the sum of angles in each triangle is strictly bigger than $\pi$.

Denote by $\sigma$ the sum of all 12 angles in 4 triangles $[y_1y_2y_3]$, $[y_1y_2y_4]$, $[y_1y_3y_4]$, and $[y_2y_3y_4]$.
From above,
\[\sigma>4\cdot\pi.\]

On the other hand, by \ref{ex:S^3/S^1} any triangle in $\Sigma_{y_1}\spc{L}$ has perimeter at most $\pi$.
In particular, 
\[\mangle\hinge{y_1}{y_2}{y_3}+\mangle\hinge{y_1}{y_3}{y_4}+\mangle\hinge{y_1}{y_4}{y_2}\le \pi.\]
Let us apply the same argument in $\Sigma_{y_2}\spc{L}$, $\Sigma_{y_3}\spc{L}$, and $\Sigma_{y_4}\spc{L}$.
Adding the results we get 
\[\sigma\le 4\cdot\pi\]
--- a contradiction.

\parit{Case 2.}
Let $F$ contains one surface $S$.
Note that the projection of $S$ to $\spc{L}$ forms its boundary $\partial \spc{L}$.
Note that doubling $\hat {\spc{L}}$ of $\spc{L}$ across its boundary has 4 singular points --- each singular point of $\spc{L}$ corresponds to two singular points of $\hat {\spc{L}}$.

By the \emph{Doubling theorem}, $\hat {\spc{L}}$ is a geodesic $\CBB(1)$ space.
Therefore we arrive at a contradiction the same way as in the first case.

\parit{Case 3.}
Suppose $F$ contains at least two surfaces.
Then $\partial\spc{L}$ has at least two connected components; choose two of them $A$ and $B$.
Denote by $\gamma$ a geodesic that minimizes the distance from $A$ to $B$.

Let 
\[\dots,\spc{L}_{-1},\spc{L}_{0},\spc{L}_{1},\dots\] two-side infinite sequence of copies on $\partial\spc{L}$.
Let us glue $\spc{L}_{i}$ to $\spc{L}_{i+1}$ along $A$ if $i$ is even and along $B$ if $i$ is odd.

By the \emph{Doubling theorem}, every point in the obtained space $\spc{N}$ has a neighborhood that is isometric to a neighborhood of the corresponding point in $\spc{L}$ or its doubling.
By the \emph{globalization theorem}, $\spc{N}$ is $\CBB(1)$.

Note that the copies of $\gamma$ in $\spc{L}_{i}$ form a line in $\spc{N}$.
By the \emph{splitting theorem}, $\spc{N}$ is isometric to a product $\spc{N}'\oplus \RR$.
The latter is impossible for $\CBB(1)$ space --- a contradiction.
(Here we used that dimension of $\spc{N}$ is bigger than 1.
According to our definitions, $\RR$ is $\CBB(1)$;
it splits trivially, but such examples exist only in dimension~1.)
